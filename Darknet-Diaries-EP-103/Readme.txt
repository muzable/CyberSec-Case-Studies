I've been listening to Darknet Diaries for some time, and One of my Favourite episodes was EP 103: CLOUD HOPPER. I even actually made a Case Study based on this episode.

How APT10 Gained Access to Multiple Government Organizations in 13 Countries.

Darknet Diaries podcast episode "Cloud Hopper" was blown away by the story of how APT10, a state-sponsored Chinese hacking group, gained initial access to an MSP computer and laterally moved across the network to access multiple government organizations in 13 countries.
The Episode detailed how APT10 used various techniques to gain access to the MSP's network, including spear phishing, watering holes, and exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party software. Once they were inside the network, they were able to move laterally using legitimate credentials and access sensitive data.
The Episode also highlighted the importance of security measures such as multi-factor authentication, network segmentation, and vulnerability management. If the MSP had implemented these measures, it is likely that APT10 would not have been able to gain such widespread access to their network.
I highly recommend listening to the "Cloud Hopper" episode of Darknet Diaries if you are interested in learning more about this case study. It is a fascinating and informative listen, and it provides valuable insights into the tactics and techniques used by state-sponsored hacking groups.
